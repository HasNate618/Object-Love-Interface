## Script

### 0:00 - Cold open
Host:
"Judges, today we are putting romance on hard mode. We built a device that lets you date any object. This is Object Love Interface."

Host:
"It uses a camera, Gemini to imagine a personality, and ElevenLabs to give it a voice. The screen shows faces and hearts, and the servo arm reacts to chemistry."

### 0:20 - Pick the date
Host (holding object to camera):
"Meet my date: this [OBJECT]. The internet told me not to do this, but the AI told me it is destiny."

Host (point to SenseCAP screen):
"I am going to hit Date."

### 0:25 - Live capture + personality generation
Stage direction:
- Tap the Date button on the SenseCAP screen.
- Device shows face mode and hearts.

Host (while it thinks):
"Camera capture goes in, Gemini describes it, then Gemini writes a full dating personality profile."

### 0:35 - Object speaks first
Device (ElevenLabs voice):
"Hi. I am [OBJECT NAME]. I am small, underestimated, and ready for a serious relationship with a human."

Host:
"The voice is ElevenLabs, streamed over WiFi to the M5 speaker. Mouth sync on the face is driven by audio amplitude."

### 0:50 - Short back-and-forth (push-to-talk)
Host (hold button, speak):
"So what are you looking for in a partner?"

Device:
"Someone who respects my personal space. Also, I am very into long walks on short shelves."

Stage direction:
- Servo arm does a small move on a good response.
- Screen shows hearts or a happy face.

Host:
"You can see the system updating the love meter and the servo reacts to how the date is going."

### 1:20 - Another quick exchange
Host (hold button, speak):
"What is your love language?"

Device:
"Acts of service. Specifically, cleaning me and never putting me in the top rack."

Host:
"That is dangerously relatable."

### 1:35 - Valentines track callout
Host:
"We are aiming for the Valentines prize track. This is a romance engine for objects."

Host:
"And for Best Use of Gemini and ElevenLabs: Gemini creates the personality and dialogue, ElevenLabs gives it an emotional voice, and our hardware brings it to life in real time."

### 1:55 - Closing beat
Host:
"So yes, you can now date your stapler. Do not judge me, judge the architecture."

Host:
"Object Love Interface. Please clap so my date does not ghost me."

## Fallback (if live demo fails)
Host:
"If the live capture is shy, here is a quick clip of the full flow. Same pipeline, just pre-recorded."

Stage direction:
- Play the short clip (15-25 seconds) of capture -> personality -> voice -> hearts -> servo.

## Notes for Timing
- Keep each device response under 1 sentence.
- If the system is slow, add one line: "Gemini is cooking a personality profile right now." 
- If audio is quiet, do a quick volume bump using the M5 control.
